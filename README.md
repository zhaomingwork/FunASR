<strong>FunASR</strong> hopes to build a bridge between academic research and industrial applications on speech recognition. By supporting the training & finetuning of the industrial-grade speech recognition model released on [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models?page=1&tasks=auto-speech-recognition), researchers and developers can conduct research and production of speech recognition models more conveniently, and promote the development of speech recognition ecology. ASR for Fun！

## What's new: 
### Multi-Channel Multi-Party Meeting Transcription 2.0 (M2MeT2.0) Challenge
We are pleased to announce that the M2MeT2.0 challenge has been accepted by the ASRU 2023 challenge special session. The registration is now open. The baseline system is conducted on FunASR and is provided as a receipe of AliMeeting corpus. For more details you can see the guidence of M2MET2.0 ([CN](https://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/FunASR/m2met2_cn/index.html)/[EN](https://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/FunASR/m2met2/index.html)).
### Release notes
For the release notes, please ref to [news](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunASR/releases)

## Highlights
- FunASR is a fundamental speech recognition toolkit that offers a variety of features, including speech recognition (ASR), Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Punctuation Restoration, Language Models, Speaker Verification, Speaker diarization and multi-talker ASR.
- We have released a vast collection of academic and industrial pretrained models on the [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models?page=1&tasks=auto-speech-recognition), which can be accessed through our [Model Zoo](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunASR/blob/main/docs/model_zoo/modelscope_models.md). The representative [Paraformer-large](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch/summary) model has achieved SOTA performance in many speech recognition tasks. 
- FunASR offers a user-friendly pipeline for fine-tuning pretrained models from the [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models?page=1&tasks=auto-speech-recognition). Additionally, the optimized dataloader in FunASR enables faster training speeds for large-scale datasets. This feature enhances the efficiency of the speech recognition process for researchers and practitioners.

## Installation

Install from pip
```shell
pip3 install -U funasr
# For the users in China, you could install with the command:
# pip3 install -U funasr -i https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple
```

Or install from source code


``` sh
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/FunASR.git && cd FunASR
pip3 install -e ./
# For the users in China, you could install with the command:
# pip3 install -e ./ -i https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple

```
If you want to use the pretrained models in ModelScope, you should install the modelscope:

```shell
pip3 install -U modelscope
# For the users in China, you could install with the command:
# pip3 install -U modelscope -f https://modelscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/releases/repo.html -i https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple
```

For more details, please ref to [installation](https://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/FunASR/en/installation/installation.html)

## Usage

You could use FunASR by:

- egs
- egs_modelscope
- runtime

### egs
If you want to train the model from scratch, you could use funasr directly by recipe, as the following:
```shell
cd egs/aishell/paraformer
. ./run.sh --CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1" --gpu_num=2
```
More examples could be found in [docs](https://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/FunASR/en/modelscope_pipeline/quick_start.html)

### egs_modelscope
If you want to infer or finetune pretraining models from modelscope, you could use funasr by modelscope pipeline, as the following:

```python
from modelscope.pipelines import pipeline
from modelscope.utils.constant import Tasks

inference_pipeline = pipeline(
    task=Tasks.auto_speech_recognition,
    model='damo/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch',
)

rec_result = inference_pipeline(audio_in='https://isv-data.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ics/MaaS/ASR/test_audio/asr_example_zh.wav')
print(rec_result)
# {'text': '欢迎大家来体验达摩院推出的语音识别模型'}
```
More examples could be found in [docs](https://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/FunASR/en/modelscope_pipeline/quick_start.html)

### runtime

An example with websocket:

For the server:
```shell
cd funasr/runtime/python/websocket
python wss_srv_asr.py --port 10095
```

For the client:
```shell
python wss_client_asr.py --host "127.0.0.1" --port 10095 --mode 2pass --chunk_size "5,10,5"
#python wss_client_asr.py --host "127.0.0.1" --port 10095 --mode 2pass --chunk_size "8,8,4" --audio_in "./data/wav.scp" --output_dir "./results"
```
More examples could be found in [docs](https://alibaba-damo-academy.github.io/FunASR/en/runtime/websocket_python.html#id2)
